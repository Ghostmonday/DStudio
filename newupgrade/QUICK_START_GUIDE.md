# 🚀 DirectorStudio - Quick Start Guide for Agent

## ⚡ 5-Minute Integration Overview

### Step 1: Copy Files to Xcode Project

```bash
# Project structure:
DirectorStudio/
├── App/
│   └── DirectorStudioApp.swift          # Main entry point
├── Storage/
│   ├── LocalStorageModule.swift         # Core Data layer
│   └── CoreDataEntities.swift           # Entity definitions
├── Sync/
│   └── SupabaseSyncEngine.swift        # Cloud sync engine
├── Pipeline/
│   └── (Your existing pipeline files)
├── UI/
│   ├── SceneControlSheet.swift          # Settings UI
│   └── CompletePipelineIntegration.swift # Integration layer
└── Resources/
    └── DirectorStudio.xcdatamodeld      # Create this
```

### Step 2: Create Core Data Model

1. File → New → File → Data Model
2. Name it `DirectorStudio.xcdatamodeld`
3. Add 4 entities following `CoreDataEntities.swift` documentation
4. Set Codegen to "Manual/None"

### Step 3: Configure Environment

Add to `Config.xcconfig`:
```
SUPABASE_URL = https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = your_key_here
```

Add to `Info.plist`:
```xml
<key>SUPABASE_URL</key>
<string>$(SUPABASE_URL)</string>
<key>SUPABASE_ANON_KEY</key>
<string>$(SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)</string>
```

### Step 4: Add Privacy Manifest

Create `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` (see CodebaseOptimizationGuide.swift line 350)

### Step 5: Wire Everything Together

The integration is already done in `DirectorStudioApp.swift`!

Just ensure:
- [x] All files compile
- [x] Core Data model matches entities
- [x] Environment variables set
- [x] Privacy manifest added

### Step 6: Test

```swift
// Run app on device
// Test these flows:
1. Create new project ✓
2. Generate scenes ✓
3. Go offline → Edit → Come online → Sync ✓
4. Purchase credits ✓
5. Generate video ✓
```

## 🎯 Key Files & Their Purpose

| File | Purpose | Key Classes |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **DirectorStudioApp.swift** | App entry point | `DirectorStudioApp`, `AppDelegate` |
| **LocalStorageModule.swift** | Offline storage | `LocalStorageManager` |
| **SupabaseSyncEngine.swift** | Cloud sync | `SupabaseSyncEngine` |
| **SceneControlSheet.swift** | Settings UI | `SceneControlSheet` |
| **CompletePipelineIntegration.swift** | Coordinator | `DirectorStudioCoordinator` |

---

## 🔌 How Components Connect

```
User Action (SceneControlSheet)
    ↓
DirectorStudioCoordinator (orchestrates)
    ↓
PipelineManager (from your existing code)
    ↓
LocalStorageManager (saves immediately)
    ↓
SupabaseSyncEngine (syncs when online)
    ↓
Supabase Database (cloud backup)
```

---

## 📝 Quick API Reference

### Storage
```swift
// Save scene
try await LocalStorageManager.shared.saveSceneDraft(draft)

// Load scenes
let scenes = try await LocalStorageManager.shared.loadSceneDrafts(for: projectId)

// Delete scene
try await LocalStorageManager.shared.deleteSceneDraft(id)
```

### Sync
```swift
// Trigger sync
await SupabaseSyncEngine.shared.syncNow()

// Check if online
let isOnline = SupabaseSyncEngine.shared.isOnline

// Get pending count
let pending = SupabaseSyncEngine.shared.pendingSyncCount
```

### Coordinator
```swift
// Create project
try await coordinator.createNewProject(title: "Film", script: "...")

// Generate scenes
await coordinator.generateScenes()

// Generate video
try await coordinator.generateVideo(for: scene)

// Load credits
await coordinator.loadCredits()
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Core Data entity not found"
**Solution**: Ensure xcdatamodeld file is added to target

### Issue: "Supabase connection failed"
**Solution**: Check environment variables in Info.plist

### Issue: "Sync not working"
**Solution**: Check network permissions in Info.plist

### Issue: "Compiler errors about Sendable"
**Solution**: Enable Swift 6 concurrency: Build Settings → Swift Compiler → Strict Concurrency = Complete
