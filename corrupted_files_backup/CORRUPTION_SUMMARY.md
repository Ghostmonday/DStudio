# DirectorStudio Build Corruption Summary

## Files Affected by Botched Pull Requests

This folder contains all the files that were corrupted or affected by the botched pull requests that caused build failures.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. DirectorStudioApp.swift
**Issue**: Incomplete switch statement missing `.background` and `.inactive` cases
**Error**: `switch must be exhaustive`
**Fix**: Added missing cases and `@unknown default` handler

### 2. StudioView.swift  
**Issue**: Incorrect property name `segment.cinematicTaxonomy` instead of `segment.cinematicTags`
**Error**: Property not found
**Fix**: Changed to correct property name

### 3. CreateView.swift
**Issue**: Incorrect class name `ProjectModel` instead of `Project`
**Error**: Cannot find 'ProjectModel' in scope
**Fix**: Changed to correct class name `Project`

### 4. RewordingModule.swift
**Issue**: File was completely empty (only contained a single empty line)
**Error**: Module referenced but not implemented
**Fix**: Restored full implementation from backup file

### 5. Empty Module Files
**Files**: 
- PromptSegmentationModule.swift
- PromptPackagingModule.swift  
- StoryAnalyzerModule.swift
**Issue**: All contained only empty lines but were referenced in code
**Status**: These may need proper implementations or removal from project

### 6. Missing CostMetricsManager
**Issue**: Class was referenced but didn't exist
**Error**: Cannot find 'CostMetricsManager' in scope
**Fix**: Created new CostMetricsManager.swift with required methods

## Build Status
- **Before**: Multiple compilation errors preventing build
- **After**: Most issues resolved, build should now succeed

## Files in This Backup
- DirectorStudioApp.swift (fixed switch statement)
- StudioView.swift (fixed property name)
- CreateView.swift (fixed class name)
- SceneCard.swift (checked for issues)
- RewordingModule.swift (restored from backup)
- RewordingModule.swift.backup (original working version)
- PromptSegmentationModule.swift (empty - needs implementation)
- PromptPackagingModule.swift (empty - needs implementation)
- StoryAnalyzerModule.swift (empty - needs implementation)

## Next Steps
1. Verify build succeeds completely
2. Implement missing module files or remove references
3. Test app functionality
4. Consider adding unit tests to prevent future regressions
