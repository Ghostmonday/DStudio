# DirectorStudio Strategic PR Automation

This directory contains automation scripts for creating focused PRs to trigger BugBot systematic review of your DirectorStudio codebase.

## 🎯 **Strategic PR Plan Overview**

The automation system creates **8 focused PRs** for systematic BugBot analysis:

1. **📱 Core App Components** - Main app entry point, content view, app state, and core data models
2. **🎨 UI Components & Views** - All UI components, views, sheets, and user interface elements  
3. **⚙️ Pipeline & Processing Modules** - AI pipeline modules, processing engines, and workflow management
4. **🔧 Services & Backend Integration** - API services, authentication, data sync, and external integrations
5. **💾 Data & Persistence Layer** - CoreData, storage, persistence, and data management
6. **⚙️ Configuration & Project Setup** - Project configuration, assets, build settings, and resources
7. **📚 Documentation & Developer Guides** - Documentation, guides, and developer resources
8. **🌐 Comprehensive Full-Stack Review** - Complete end-to-end scan of entire codebase

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **Option 1: Execute All PRs Automatically (Recommended)**
```bash
# Run the complete strategic plan
./automation/execute-all-prs.sh
```

### **Option 2: Start with Most Critical First**
```bash
# Start with core app components
./automation/local-to-pr.sh 'Core App Components Review' 'BugBot scan of main app entry point, content view, app state, and core data models'
```

### **Option 3: Manual Step-by-Step**
```bash
# Execute each PR individually
./automation/local-to-pr.sh 'UI Components & Views Review' 'BugBot scan of all UI components, views, sheets, and user interface elements'
./automation/local-to-pr.sh 'Pipeline & Processing Modules Review' 'BugBot scan of AI pipeline modules, processing engines, and workflow management'
# ... continue with remaining PRs
```

## 📁 **Script Files**
